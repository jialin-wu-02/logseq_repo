## {DONE}} [[Web Development @ Berkeley]] Finish most of the theoretical part. To start working on the real world part, I probably need to wait for the "over-arching" project.

## DONE [[Sedge]] Work on importing a function from `music.py`
### Have some trouble with [[Python]] import.

## [[Aimhub]] Decide to change the navbar into cards
### It's essentially a dashboard, and therefore having cards make more sense than a strange navbar

## [[Sedge]] Way for rebooting the [[Database]]
### Delete `site.db` file

### Run `Python3` inside `server/` folder

### ```clojure
from sedgeserver import db
db.create_all()```

## {DONE}} Cache [[Sedge]] array data inside database

## {DONE}} Just realize that I need to teach two sections for [[Web Development @ Berkeley]], each 1.5 hour.
