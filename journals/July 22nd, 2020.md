## 2.5 Million users for splice, meaning quite a lot of potential users for [[Sedge]].

## The track fault pr for [[Aimhub]] becomes [[Track Info and Send Data via Socket]]
### A quote from the slack channel that I post:
#### Hey everyone, currently if a process encounters an error, the user would have no way of noticing this. As a result, I am setting up a socket connection between the aim & aimde. By sending process status, the user would be notified if an error occurs.
Also, right now all the information of a run cannot be automatically updated: if a process is running, you have to manually refresh the experiment detail page to get the latest data. Since I am setting up a socket connection and checking the status, I am thinking that we can also send data regarding all the metrics, aka losses, accuracies… This way data can be updated automatically without the user manually refresh the page.
