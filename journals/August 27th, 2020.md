### Reflect on these discussions of the future of computing. What ideas resonate with us now? What ideas inspired you? What are your visions for computing in 2030?

### It's amazing that people from 60 years ago can predict our present in such a detailed fashion. Just like how the first and the third video predicts, we are now entirely dependent on computers. Most of the information that we need is easily accessible through the help of search engines, and we can also book services and products online as well. Computer and global network enable this nomadic lifestyle where people are able to work remotely. This seems particularly relevant nowadays where everyone is able to work from home. 

The second video also hints at the change of self-identification. Our identity and involvement with the world around us shift tremendously. We are no longer defined by our "facts", but by the relationship that we have with other people. We can also shape and create our own identity online. The distances between each other also dissolve. Providing one's attention has become the most valuable thing now.

I believe in the future, computing is going to have a much more intimate relationship with us. With the development of IoT devices and sensors, we would have quicker and easier ways to interact with this digital world that we built. Computing devices are no longer limited to computers and phones. Most of the daily objects will become an entry point to the digital world. We don't need to provide them with heavy computing power, since we can do all computing in the cloud and use high-speed network to download everything the device needs. Everything will become much more portal, accessiable, instant, and intuitive. 

With information becoming more accessiable, education will become something much different from nowadays. We will be learning how to learn, how to live a better life, how to build relationships, how to be creative, instead of knowledge and facts, since all those knowledge and facts will become so easily accessible that spending time to learn it will not make any sense.

### This is likely an emotional reading...and that is ok.  What can we learn from this important perspective on design?  Did a particular design (or designs) resonate with you?  Why?  How can we grow in our own practice towards more equitable designs?

### Some of the designs in the reading shock me. Design should be inclusive. Design should not be used to ignore or avoid problems. We should use design as a way to confront problems within our society directly and try to solve them. We should make our society as a whole better, rather than making the life of a few seemingly better.
One particular design that resonates with me is the "defensive architecture" in the first part of the reading. Defensive architectures are architectures that prevent homeless people to rest and sleep in a particular area. The problem of this design is that it is ignoring the problem that our society is facing and trying to get rid of this problem using the simplest brute force way. People could have designed and created designated areas for homeless people to stay and shelters for them to live. However, they want to just chase the homeless people away and ignore them completely. By ignoring problems, we cannot address the real problems that we are facing. Good designs are designs that are brave enough to address the roots of these problems and smart enough to solve or alleviate the impact of these problems. Building walls along the border is never the solution, building spikes on the ground is not the solution neither. We should be inclusive and treat every human being as a human being with the same rights that we have.
To become better at creating more equitable designs, we should look not only at the surface of the problems but at the heart of the problems. Good designs solve the root of the problems. We should be inclusive and treat everyone as equals. We should let everyone become the test subject of our design and see how our design will interact with the real world. This is the only way that we can make more inclusive designs.

### Q: Think about a recent frustrating experience you have had interacting with a digital device or system.  Discuss how one or more of the four elements of the design interaction process (p. 15) could have improved the design.

### A: I am a Junior right now, and I have been using bcourses (canvas for Berkeley) for three years. One thing that frustrates me quite a lot is the inability to hide inactive classes on the dashboard. It has become a headache to look through all 21 courses that I have taken just to find the three courses that I am taking this semester.
From the book Interaction Design, to improve the current course dashboard, we need to revisit the "evaluating" process. Observing user behavior in the real world is important. We should bring students from different majors and various years in college to see how they interact with the dashboard. We would easily discover this issue after some observation of junior and senior students trying to find their courses among a bunch of inactive courses.
After we discover the issue, we go back to the prototype stage and come up with another design. For example, we can allow instructors to make a class inactive. Then the course will be hidden from the dashboard. Students can still access the hidden courses from a plus button at the end of the page. This will solve the issue of having too many inactive classes showing on the dashboard.

### [[Interaction Design]]
#### "Designing spaces for human communication and interactions."

#### User Experience:
##### "One cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience."
###### We use features to invoke satisfying user experience.

#### Process of interaction design:
##### Establishing requirements

##### Designing activities

##### Prototyping

##### Evaluating

#### Be careful about the followings:
##### People's sensitivities (old does not want to be treated as they are cognitively disabled). 

##### Cultural differences.
