### Q: The vision of Ubiquitous Computing presented and prototyped in this paper was likely made well before you were even born!  How close do you think this vision is to our world today?  Discuss an element or elements of this vision have not yet arrived? Will it every happen?  Why or why not?
#### This vision of Ubiquitous Computing is definitely very close to our world today. The idea of having "tabs, pads, and board" is very similar to the "phone, tablet, and computer" combination that we have right now. 

#### The article predicts that we will have more than a hundred devices present in a room. This may not seem like the case right now, but I believe this will eventually happen in the future, and it will be very similar to what the article envisions. The "tabs" will be all the IoT devices living inside our lamps, our coffee machines, our doors, and our refrigerators. Instead of having screens like the article mentions, they may not have screens at all, but they can react to the different kinds of instructions that the user provides. With the development of speedy network and the decrease in the cost of sensors, IoT devices will be more affordable, and with more and more people using IoT devices, the ecosystem will become more vibrant. This will definitely happen in the future. 

#### The article also predicts the appearance of pad, and the prediction is surprisingly similar to the world that we live in right now. "people will have to become accustomed to having pads and tabs on a desk as an adjunct to computer screens before taking embodied virtuality any further." This seems particularly true since we now use both pads and computers together. I believe this is an element of the vision that has already arrived.

### Q: What elements of the design from these two early interactive computing systems did you find compelling?  How do they relate to specific technologies of today?

### A: These two interactive computing systems are the foundations of two of the most important tools today ---- mouse and video conferencing. Though they certainly accomplish different functionalities, they share something similar ---- they both add ways for people to interact with the computing system more naturally.

### Before the mouse, people's main methods of input is the keyboard. People use the keyboard to type down commands, and those commands will be displayed on a screen. With the mouse, people can point at specific things on the screen and interact with those things without remembering long commands. Pointing at things is a very easy and natural way to interact with the world around us. It is something that everyone is capable of doing. Mouse also opens up the possibility of the graphic user interface, and thus allow the computer to become more accessible. Mouse certainly helps the invention of modern-day mouse and also trackpad. 

### Video telephone allows people to not only use text and sounds, but also videos of each other, to communicate. People tend to use a lot of body language and gestures when communicating. Video telephone allows people to see each other in real-time. By seeing each others' gestures and facial expressions, people can understand each other more easily. This prototype of video telephone inspires the laptop to have a camera on the top of the screen and also inspire products like Zoom and facetime.

## [[THOUGHTS]] I have no friends... or not?
### It's very strange to write this down, but I think, I actually have no friends.

### Maybe it is just how this covid-19 thing is. People are more disconnected now than ever. It is harder to maintain previous relationships, and it is even harder to form new groups. I felt like the only connection with the outside world for me right now is through Jennifer, and I do think that this is not that a very healthy relationship to maintain with this world around me.

### If asked where should I go to find some supports and friends, I probably gonna shake my head. It is true that I didn't have that much friend to go to.

### Just talk to Jennifer, and I think it is crucial to reach out, be vulnerable and talk to others.
