## Create a [[Template]] for project.
### Keyword:
Due Date: 
Goal:
#### It's kinda funny that I need to click an extra shift + tab to un-indent my meta-data, but this is good enough.

#### Source: u/kicki22

#### https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hbhtdo/pasting_with_soft_line_breaks_from_alfred/

## I think I need to organize my [[Roam]] a little bit more, so let's do that.
### First, we need to create "index" page for different catagories of notes.
#### The catagories will be:
##### [[AREA]]

##### [[COURSE]]

##### [[PEOPLE]]

##### [[PROJECT]]

##### [[CAREER]]

##### [[THOUGHTS]]

##### [[ARCHIVE]]

### Second, we need to think about how we use [[Roam]]. Let's write down some use cases.
#### When I listen to lectures, I would drop down notes on lecture.
##### This requires a note [[Template]].

#### When I have a thought on something, I would drop down one or two sentences.
##### This is a random thought, it would often link to something new, this requires no template.

#### I would drop down todos. Todos can have template.
##### {DONE}} This is a TODO.
Due Date: [[August 30th, 2020]]

##### After some thinkings, I think a Due Date is enough.

### After some thoughts, I feel like notes should be pretty spontaneous.
#### However, this requires some degree of rules.

#### The most simple rules will generate complex yet manageable spontanity.

## Some takeaways for [[Intern]] hunting #CAREER
### Be sure to check whether the job position is open or not. It is very easy for people to assume that you are applying for full-time position instead of internship!

## {DONE}} [[CS194]] Improve image pyramid. 
### [[Yibin Li]]: Let's say that the optimum displacement at the top level is 5, and your scale factor is 0.1. For the second-top level, you need to at least search between 40-60 (you always search for the integer pixel) since you didn't search anything like 4.6 or 5.5 at the top level. This applies to both x and y directions.

### ```python
# The normal single align
ag = translate(g, align(g, b))
ar = translate(r, align(r, b))```

## Letter to [[Asma Kazmi]]
### Dear Professor Asma,

Thanks a lot for your call today. I have spent some time exploring the different options that will help us with the residency project. I know that you are going to give me the formal decision tomorrow, but I just want to share some of my progress.

Currently, I am picturing something along the lines of this: artists are able to stream their work live through youtube stream. We will embed the youtube live stream within our own website. To allow audiences greater freedom, we will craft the audiences' interaction ourselves. It can be buttons to "virtually" wave hands at the artist or create separate "rooms" to talk with the artist.

I have already put up a prototype of the website containing an embedded youtube stream and a mock-up for the audience interaction room. It works great. I would love to discuss more details about the residency and would love to share what I have made. 

It is definitely exciting to be able to work on this residency project. It is something that I am passionate about.  

Thanks,
Alex Wu

## [[CS160]] OH with [[Eric Paulos]]
### Questions
#### Thanks a lot for the code.

#### Just talk with Asma, it's pretty great.

#### I come from a more computer science background, I am pretty good at web design & web development. Wondering what's the best way to get involved in HCI researches? Would you mind recommending some potential Ph.D. students?
##### Reading group.

#### I am thinking of starting my own research. 
##### Kinda like the logo programming language, but in a hardware way.

##### Hardware is still pretty hard for the kids.

##### Programming + hardware.
###### Block like things.

### Hey everyone, I am Alex, an undergraduate studying CS160 now. I talked with Professor Paulos asking for ways to learn more about HCI researches, and he recommend me here. Definitely excited to join the group and learn more from y'all!
