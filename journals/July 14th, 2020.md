## [[Sedge]] Work on the music visualizer by hand-write a SVG Bar chart.
### Here is a small example of how a bar chart may be built: https://bl.ocks.org/flunky/09da59137df27a9af7e121dc30feaa38

## DONE Need to change the [[Database]] for [[Sedge]] from [[SQLite]] to [[PostgreSQL]] due to SQLite's inability to store array 
### If we want to store array, we need to convert it into string and back again, which costs a lot of time.
