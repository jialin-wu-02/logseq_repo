## {DONE}} [[July 25th, 2020]] Talk with Sam about [[Sedge]]. 
### He talked about how files from FLStudio & ableton may not be able to import directly.
#### Needs extra "sound origin" to make it work.

## [[Sedge]] F1 Status found a startup?
### Truth: In my conversation with my company lawyer, I learned that foreigners can start companies in the U.S. As a matter of fact, many of my international classmates at school have incorporated their companies while in school or after school. However, you do need to be under the appropriate working visa or OPT to be compensated for productive work.

### While applying for your H-1B or other non-immigrant visas for a company in which you are a co-founder, a foreigner cannot own a majority stake (more than 50 percent) in a company and must prove that he or she does not have the controlling power in the firm either through a well-developed board of directors or having other majority shareholders.
