## DONE Reply to Gor & Gevorg

## Turns out migrate to [[PostgreSQL]] is pretty hard... 
### Decent tutorial that goes over postgres and also [[Redis]]:
https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-2-postgres-sqlalchemy-and-alembic/

### Finally, I use this tutorial to upgrade to postgres: https://blog.theodo.com/2017/03/developping-a-flask-web-app-with-a-postresql-database-making-all-the-possible-errors/

### Also include **Alembic** to support migration and update. 

### {DONE}} Still need to test data insertion and all that.

## In this [[Youtube]]: [What's Next for Notion?! Predictions with Tiago Forte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7UFEqKnjiE&list=LLbk-vDktrsxICJroJcuNCOQ&index=2&t=401s) Tiago talked about how [[Notion]] is very similar to [[Google Docs]] #Blog
### I think this [[Thoughts]] of comparing Notion with Google Docs instead of a note taking app is very interesting.
#### People think Notion is a note taking app, however, there is no easy entry for daily notes ( in other words, no inbox). 

#### Notion is more like a digital archive, or a Dashboard. The notes on Notion is often time permanent. However, if it is truly a notebook, it should be able to contain unorganized notes with ease. 

#### Another evidence to support that is that Notion is used by quite a lot of startup companies to document their tech stacks / marketing strategy.

#### Notion is not a note taking app, ^^it is a text-based customizable dashboard.^^

## [[Thoughts]] A `NoteExchange` app, written for people to ask note-taking app related questions, compare between different kinds of note.
### kinda like stackexchange but for notes taking apps.

## [[HCI]] I do think that a gesture analyzing band is pretty good.
### For muscle sensor, we can use this: https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage
#### It's pretty cheap.

### We should have two bands: one on the forearm and one on the waist. This way it can detect hand gestures and waist motion more easily.

## Update and migrate [[PostgreSQL]] for [[Sedge]]
### ```clojure
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade```

### https://blog.theodo.com/2017/03/developping-a-flask-web-app-with-a-postresql-database-making-all-the-possible-errors/

### When the database is not initialized.
#### First, go to psql and create the database.
##### ```clojure
$ psql
# create database wordcount_dev;
CREATE DATABASE
# \q```

#### ```clojure
python manage.py db init```

## To ensure that [[PostgreSQL]] update its column type during migration, we can add `migrate = Migrate(compare_type=True)`

## Support Array type in [[PostgreSQL]] through [[SQLAlchemy]]
### https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23543977/filter-with-array-column-with-postgres-and-sqlalchemy

### ```clojure
from sqlalchemy.dialects import postgresql
numbers = Column(postgresql.ARRAY(Integer))```
