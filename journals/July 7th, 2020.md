## [[Aimhub]] daily work log
### Develop
#### Wrap up the PR for hiding and revert hiding a process

### CRM
#### Talk with Steven, Yibin about aim.

## [[Web Development @ Berkeley]] Teaching Section Prep
### Topic
#### Build a react counter

### Goal
#### Learn the two most important concepts in React
##### Component

##### State

### Lesson Plan
#### What is React? Why React?
##### A javascript library for building web interfaces.

##### A very modern library.
###### Traditionally, we use HTML + CSS + JS.

###### No way to reuse the same component.

###### If we want to build something like [dribble](https://dribbble.com/), it would be pretty time-consuming to paste cards over and over again.

###### __It would be great to treat cards as a function and allow it to be rendered differently according to different inputs.__

##### In react, this kind of function is called a `component`. 
###### `component` is the core of React.
####### React treats everything as a component.

###### We can reuse component in a very easy way!

#### Introduce `create-react-app`

#### Introduce React Project Structure
##### `public` folder
###### serve static files

###### `index.html` 
####### the only html file that you will ever need. 

####### Entry point for React.
######## `<div id="root"></div>` is empty!

######## will be filled by React

##### `src` folder
###### the folder that you will be working with most extensively.

###### `index.js` put whatever you wrote for React into the root div.

###### `App.js` is your "home page"
####### It contains all the components that you will write for a react application.

###### You can write normal css like `App.css` and import them into the javascript files.

#### Let's write a Counter!
##### Another important idea in React
###### State.

###### React use state to manage all the changing parts.

## [[Web Development @ Berkeley]] onboarding
### DONE Ask questions [[July 7th, 2020]]
#### Should student choose a stack or teach them both?
##### I think probably choose a stack instead of teaching them both for the backend.

### DONE Deadline for preparing lesson plan [[July 13t
#### h, 2020]]
