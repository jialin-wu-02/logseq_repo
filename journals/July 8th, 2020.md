## Build a page for people

## Working on building a connection "database" in [[Roam]]
### First thing that comes to mind is that we can use `[[Category::Thing]]` to easily create connections between pages.
#### This probably "violates" the idea of Roam?? Not sure thought, but to me this is like the easiest way to create a "index" system without creating an index page.

#### This will create a graph like this:
##### ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fjialin-wu-roam%2F6vAAoEYlfU.png?alt=media&token=2fbe8877-f85c-4b00-816d-3770146c8210)

##### This is probably not that interconnected, and we can hardly see the relationship between people.

### Another way of handling this problem and solve the "flat graph issue" is to add a tag to related pages.
#### For example, give Caroline Winnett a people tag inside its own page.

#### CONS: The problem for this is that it is harder to type out one's name if I don't remember them.

#### PROS: We can see the connections between different people.

#### I will stick with this way for now.

### ^^Inherently, this is a problem of completely decentralized vs. some centralized. ^^

## Some advice for [[Roam]]
### Once your cursor is at the headline, if you type enter, you should go to the start of the page. [[Notion]] is doing this, and it is pretty good.

### This is a [medium post](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/the-google-vs-trick-618c8fd5359f) detailing the idea of VS Graph.
