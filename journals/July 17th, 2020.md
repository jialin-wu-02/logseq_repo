## [[Productivity Game]] The 4 Disciplines of Execution by Chris McChesney #Book #Business
### Summary
#### Provide 4 disciplines to allow better execution of an idea.

### Content
#### First Discipline: Focus on the WIG(widely important goal)
##### “If everything else remained at its current level of performance, what one achievement would make everything else seem secondary?”

#### ^^Second Discipline: Measure Lead Behaviors^^
##### There are two kinds of measurement of behaviors:
###### Lead behavior measurement
####### measurements of day-to-day activities that leads to the critical results.

####### Example: ten sales calls per day. Write a new module this week.

###### Lag behavior measurement
####### measurement of the results that you want.

####### Example: increase sales revenue by ten percent. Build a startup.

##### We should measure those lead behavior measurement, since it is easier to measure, and you can see the increase of it daily.

#### ^^Third Discipline: Put up a scoreboard^^
##### Without the scoreboard, people will slowly lose their will and become demotivated. Also lose track of your measurements.

##### Create a scoreboard that includes:
###### WIG (title at the top of the scoreboard)

###### Lag Measurement as line chart

###### Lead measurements as bar chart

##### [[Thoughts]] Personally, I can resonate this quite a lot. As I am building sedge,  I am kinda losing the motivation. 
###### I think I should first divide the whole sedge app into small tasks.

###### Then, label out all the steps as a bar chart that I have taken to get there.

###### This way I can visualize my daily progress. Definitely will help motivate.

#### ^^Fourth Discipline: Schedule Weekly Accountability Talks^^
##### report on last week’s commitment

##### review the scoreboard and describe the actions you took to advance your WIG

##### commit to a lead behavior improvement or a specific deliverable
for this week.

## [[Aimhub]] new task: Show process progress, status and traceback in case of fault
### Design

### Implementation
#### Connections
##### tcp connction between aim and aimde where aim will stream procoess stdout to aimde

##### web socket connection to send received stdout information to the client

##### integrate a message broker service for a robust flow
