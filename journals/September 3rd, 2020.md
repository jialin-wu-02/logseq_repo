## Really like the TODO system that [[Nat Eliason]] is using for [[Roam]].
### [Example here.](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamTutorial/page/X6Wu67zuw)

### Essentially, it is building a weekly plan for each week, write all the todos there, choose the date there, and receive some linked reference in the dates assigned.

### One problem with it that it does not feel like a very [[Roamanic]] way of recording things. The todos do not really generate them on the fly, and it feels very centeralized.

### My solution is to build a [[inbox]] feature, and when a TODO comes into mind, we first write it down in the daily notes, then we link it to the weekly todo page.

### We will then revisit the weekly todo page to gather all the thoughts and ideas.

### Title:
#### The Adaptation of Personal and Public Spaces

### Description:
#### As the pandemic became worse and worse, most of the schools and companies decided to move to the "cloud". Instead of in-person meetings and lectures, people turned to video conferencing as the main way of communication. This transition had caused some drastic changes to the notion of personal and public spaces and also interactions within those spaces. 

#### The idea of personal space had become more ambiguous facing this transition. Personal spaces started to be constantly invaded by video meetings and random calls from colleagues or classmates. Before COVID-19, it was very rare that we would allow strangers to peek at our rooms. During COVID-19, this became something inevitable as we need to open cameras to have a video conference. We would also work in our own personal space instead of the usual workspace. This also blurs our definition of personal space. Personal space, in turn, also invaded our workspace. Students may hear other classmates' family members chatting in the background. Some may feel uncomfortable that others would overhear some more personal information. The overlap of personal space and workspace had forced some of our relationships to become more intimate in good and bad ways. 

#### Public spaces had almost disappeared facing this transition. Before COVID-19, people would unconsciously interact with lots of familiar and unfamiliar people every day. When you were sitting in a cafe eating lunch, you may accidentally encounter one of your friends; when you were walking to the next lecture, you would find yourself walking among hundreds of other students taking the same course. It's very easy to start and form new relationships with others in public spaces like these. During COVID-19, most of our interactions with others are driven by a specific purpose. Since we can directly meet others in video conferences, we didn't need to spend time walking in a public space. Thus, it becomes increasingly harder to form new relationships with others. It is very hard to mimic an open public space online. Real public space allows multiple people speaking at the same time and not interfere with each other. The notion of distance is also hard to recreate.

### Stars
#### Ions will absorb some specific wavelength, thus we can determine what kinds of elements are in the stars.

### Spectral Lines
#### Electrons have **discrete** energy level.

#### With the right energy from a photon, the electron may get to a higher energy level.

#### Rule:
##### Can't absorb part of photon's energy

##### Can't absorb two photons at the same time.

## Reading [[Soylent: A Word Processor with a Crowd Inside]]
### Source: http://up.csail.mit.edu/other-pubs/soylent.pdf

### By [[BjÃ¶rn Hartmann]]

### "Embedding paid crowd workers in an interactive user interface to
support complex cognition and manipulation tasks on demand."

### Challenges include how to coordinate a large amount of people on a more subject task.
#### Variances. => Lazy Turkers and Eager Beaver.

#### Errors.

### **Find-Fix-Verify Pattern**
#### Separate each stage to minimize variances between workers.

#### Really like this idea. This helps to coordinate people in an effective way.

### {DONE}} Connect her to Linkedin probably. Just to know more about her and build a relationship. https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-raju-5557422/

## [[Ted Talk]] [[Sleep with Science]]
### Two types of sleep
#### REM: Rapid Eye Movement Sleep
##### Dream happens.

##### Brain wave activity speeds up.

##### Emotional first-aid, creativity.

#### NREM: None-REM.
##### STAGE 1: Awake / light sleep

##### STAGE 2: light sleep
###### Heart rate decrease, electrical brain wave activity slows down

##### STAGE 3 / Final: Deep sleep
###### Electrical brain wave erupts.

###### Improve memory.

#### 90 minutes cycle.

### [[Caffeine]] and [[Alcohol]] effects your sleep.
#### Caffeine wakes you up and change the quality of sleep, especially NREM stage three and four.

#### Alcohol is not a sleep-aid. Sedation is not sleep. Alcohol repress the firing of the brain cells. That's not how sleep work. 

### Sleep helps with your memory.
#### Sleep will help with "file transfer".
##### From [[hippocampus]] (information inbox) to the [[cortex]]

##### Kinda like transferring files from the usb stick to the hard drive.

#### Sleep also "replay" memory in a very rapid way.

#### Sleep also helps with integration with different memory.

### Sleep helps with emotion.
#### [[amygdala]] is responsible for generating strong emotional reactions.
##### With more sleep, amygdala becomes normal.

##### Deprived sleep will makes amygdala becomes hyperreactive.

#### [[prefrontal cortex]], CEO of the brain. Making decisions.
##### Controls amygdala.

##### With more sleep, prefrontal cortex communicates with amygdala better.

### Sleep helps your immune system.

### We need 7-9 hours of sleep.

### Tips:
#### Be regular.

#### If you can't fall asleep in 25 mins, do not stay in bed, instead, get up and do something different. Otherwise, brain will associate bed with wakefulness.

#### Have a wind-down routine.
