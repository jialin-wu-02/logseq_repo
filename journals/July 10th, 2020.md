## [[Aimhub]] Create top bar to display process related information.

## [[Roam]] Write releases and benchmarks, not everything that comes to mind.
### I think this is one of the most important realization that comes to me when using [[Roam]]. Instead of keeping track of when I start, when I end, and where I stuck for each task, I should only keep one bullet point for each task, and in that bullet point, record everything.

### For instance, Aimhub's daily work log should not be filled with `timestamp - I start to work on xxx.` `timestamp - I finally finish it.`
#### ^^However, there should be a systematic template to ensure consistency and minimize redundancy.^^

### ^^I purpose using task name as the branch name.^^
#### and the leaves will be the implementation details of a task.

#### This definitely has become much clearer compared to how the original `daily work log` looks.

## [[Sedge]] Play around with the scipy package, trying out `wavio`.
### Turns out that a package called [wavio](https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/wavio) can be used to parse music much more easily.
#### It can help parse and read 8-, 16-, 24- and 32-bit integer WAV files, which is huge.
