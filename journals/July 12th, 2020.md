## [[Sedge]] After some digging, fix the issue of not being able to import `librosa`
### Take a look at [this issue](https://github.com/librosa/librosa/issues/1160).

### Essentially, we have to use `librosa 0.7.2` with `numba 0.45.0`
#### I am using pip to manage the version right now.

## While working on [[Sedge]], kinda gain some inspiration from [[Splice]]

### The UI is clean and neat. I particularly like the bar chart that they are providing.

### The comment feature is not that great.

### They provide little to none information about a music.

### There is no way to easily keep track of one's thought.
#### no way to add TODOs, pictures...

## DONE Should probably do a competitor analysis in the near future.

#### Can be a interesting article to see.

#### Realize that Steven already has done a pretty job explaining things.
