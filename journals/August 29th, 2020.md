## [[What is Science?]] From [[The Cosmos Astronomy in the New Millennium]]
### Science is the systematic enterprise of gathering knowledge about the
world and organizing and condensing that knowledge into testable
laws and theories. The success and credibility of science is anchored in
the willingness of scientists to: Expose their ideas and results to
independent testing and replication by other scientists; this requires the
complete and open exchange of data, procedures, and materials;

### Abandon or modify accepted conclusions when confronted with more
complete or reliable experimental evidence. Adherence to these
principles provides a mechanism for self-correction that is the
foundation of the credibility of science.
