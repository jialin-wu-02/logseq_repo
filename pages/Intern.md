## [[Linkedin]] Conversation Starter for looking for internship.
### Hey **Bing**, thanks a lot for connecting. I am Alex, an upcoming Junior studying CS @ Berkeley.

Last year, my internship @ Schlumberger was rescinded due to covid19, and I have to find another internship at a small startup at Berkeley. Though I cannot work in person with the team, this experience of working at a startup definitely taught me some valuable lessons.

Now I am actively searching for next year summer's internship. I saw that you are a software engineer @ **Google**. **Google** has always been my dream company, and I would love to work/intern @ **Google** in the future. It would mean a lot to me if I can learn more from you and how is it like to work @ **Google**.

A little bit more about me, I am a developer focusing on full-stack development & system engineering. I am also a startup founder passionate about empowering people by building and giving them the right tool.

Again, thanks a lot for connecting. Wish to talk to you more about working @ **Google** and learn more from you.

## [[Linkedin]] Follow up conversation & ask for referral
### Hi Shun,

Wow, thanks a lot for this detailed reply. This is definitely very informative for me. I just took a look at the Engineering Resident program. It definitely seems promising, and I think I will apply after I graduate from Berkeley. Also thanks a lot for offering your time to do a resume review. 

I will apply to the software engineering intern position that Google is offering. Would you mind referring me through the employee referral program @ Google? This would help to speed up the application process a lot! I know this is a lot to ask, but I consider myself a competent and passionate engineer, and I would love to join Google and find more like-minded people (like you) there.

This is the job link that I am applying: https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/141314623220392646/

To be honest this is my first time trying to reach out to people on Linkedin. Thanks a lot for the avid response. Seeing you trying to give back to the community truly inspires me. This means a lot to me. I will definitely try to do something similar to help more people after I graduate.

## Experience of teaching: 
### Oh yeah definitely. So I am an AI for 61A and a Mentor in CSM for 61C. I also teach web development in our club web development @ Berkeley. 

I would talk about my experience in CSM cus 61C is my favorite course so far. Essentially I am in charge of teaching students concepts and also go over some worksheet with them. Each week I hold a section for an hour, reviewing concepts, going through some interesting problems of various levels, answering students' questions, and also providing feedback for other mentors. I also held a final review session together with some other mentors, going over RAID and other distributed system designs. It's definitely a lot of fun.

## Internship Experience
### For internship, I will talk about the one I just finished. I worked as a software engineer intern @ aimhub, a local startup company working on machine learning version control. The startup is really small since it is only pre-seed stage, so I am able to involve in some of the most important tasks.

One of the coolest things I am able to work on is to build a real-time communication channel between machine learning processes and the platform. I have only used socket in 162 before, so it's pretty challenging for me to navigate through all the networking & system configurations. I remember spending days trying to put up an echo server between the socket in the docker container and the ones in local machine learning processes. In the end I was able to produce this improved "track" function where users can call aim.track() in their python files, and all the metrics for machine learning will be automatically send to the platform. I also built an endpoint to constantly polling info from the server and displaying them on the website, definitely something very exciting.

## Recommendation Letter
### Alex is a devoted software engineer and full-stack developer. He started to work as a software engineer intern for a visa service company when he finished his first year at Berkeley. He was able to produce clean and efficient code and . In his second year, he became a research assistant to build a platform for analyzing astronomical data. After he redesigned and built the home page of the portal, he added ways to monitor all the API calls, making the portal more secure. Last summer he worked as an intern for Aimhub, a company building version control and management system for machine learning models. He involved in building some of the core functionality of the version control system, including a real time communication channel between the machine learning models and the management system.

### Alex is also a passionate entrepreneur. He created [sedge.io](http://sedge.io), a web app for music producers to manage their samples and music production process. He was willing to contribute his experience in Computer Science and use it to empower other creative workers.
